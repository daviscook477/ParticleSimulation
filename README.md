Particle simulation with emitters and particles. Emitters emit particles very often. Particles are influenced by electrical forces. Each emitter has a specific electric charge and the particles emitted from it have unit charge of the same sign as the emitter. This leads to an interesting simulation almost like that of orbits but with the posibility of particles being repelled too.
